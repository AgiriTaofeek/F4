## My process
as usual, I centered the content and items at the viewport and try to make the block component look so similar to the design images
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I was able to clear about css grid place-content and place-items properties

### Continued development

CSS is a really tricky technology, I hope to continue learning more about it to continually get better at it.
